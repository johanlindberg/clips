# CLIPS Feature Tests

This directory contains all of the CLIPS 6.24 feature tests.

To run the tests, launch CLIPS in the same directory and execute a (batch "testall.tst") command. When execution completes you can look at the *.rsl files for the results. If difference occurs you can use a diff program to compare the associate output file (.out) with the expected output file (.exp).
