(defun clear ()
  "Clears CLIPS.

   Removes all constructs  and all associated data structures (such as facts and
   instances) from the CLIPS environment. A clear may be performed safely at any
   time, however, certain constructs will not allow themselves to be deleted
   while they are in use. For example, while deffacts are being reset (by the
   reset command), it is not possible to remove them using the clear command.

   Note that the clear command does not effect many environment characteristics
   (such as the current conflict resolution strategy). This function has no
   return value.

   See CLIPS Basic Programming Guide '13.1.6 Clearing CLIPS' for more
   information.

   Syntax:
     (clear)
